Share folders in an Open Directory without making your entire server public. Manages users with OAuth2.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running. To obtain the binary you will use to run the app, follow the [Development](#development) or [Deployment](#deployment) sections for futher direction. Below, are general directions for all builds.

### Options

Use these to configure your Andesite instance. All are optional. "Name" refers to the name of the CLI flag that may be used. "Config Name" refers to the key name inside of your `config.json`. More on that later.

| Name | Config Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--root` | `"root"` | `string` | none. | Path of root directory for `/files/`. |
| `--public` | `"public"` | `string` | none. | Path of root directory for `/public/`. |
| `--port` | `"port"` | `int` | `8000` | Port for web server to bind to. |
| `--base` | `"base"` | `string` | `/` | HTTP path of app root. |
| `--config` | n/a. | `string` | `~/.config/andesite/config.json` | The path to the `config.json` file used for app configuration. |
| `--enable-search` | `"search_on"` | `string[]` | none. | Names of roots to scan and add to the file database. |
| `--disable-search` | `"search_off"` | `string[]` | none. | Names of roots to remove from the file database. |
| | `"roots_public"` | `string[][]` | none. | Enabled roots that don't lie on `/public/` by adding entries `[url_path,fs_path]`. |
| | `"roots_private"` | `string[][]` | none. | Enabled roots that don't lie on `/files/` by adding entries `[url_path,fs_path]`. |
| `--verbose` | `"verbose"` | `boolean` | `false` | Set to true to enable verbose logging. |
| `--fsdb-verbose` | `"verbose_fsdb"` | `boolean` | `false` | Set to true to enable verbose fsdb logging. |
| `--disable-hash` | | `string[]` | none. | Any of `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`, `sha512`, `sha3`, `blake2b`. |
| `--hash-concurrency` | | `int` | cpu count | Number of hashes to run concurrently. |
| `--custom-root-public` | | `string[]` | none | Similar to `"roots_public"`, passed in the form `name=path`. |
| `--custom-root-private` | | `string[]` | none | Similar to `"roots_private"`, passed in the form `name=path`. |
| `--disable-global-search` | `bool` | `false` | When true, `/search` requires being an admin to use. |

> Note: for `--enable-search` and `--disable-search`, sending values to these flags will trigger a background scan of the root directory you point it at (whether that be `public`, `files`, etc). As such, unless content is changed or updated, it is not necessary to pass these flags across multiple runs of the app.

### Creating Credentials

In order to create a "closed directory" with Andesite, you will need to create an app on your Identity Provider(s) of choice. See the [nektro/go.oauth2](https://github.com/nektro/go.oauth2#readme) docs for more detailed info on this process on where to go and what data you'll need.

Here you can also fill out a picture and description that will be displayed during the authorization of users on your chosen Identity Provider. When prompted for the "Redirect URI" during the app setup process, the URL to use will be `http://andesite/callback`, replacing `andesite` with any origins you wish Andesite to be usable from, such as `example.com` or `localhost:800`.

Once you have finished the app creation process you should now have a Client ID and Client Secret. These are passed into Andesite through flags as well.

The Identity Provider IDs used below can be found in the table in the [nektro/go.oauth2](https://github.com/nektro/go.oauth2#creating-credentials) documentation under the "Short Code" column.

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--oauth2-client` | `string[]` | none. | `idp_id|id|secret` |

## Deployment

Pre-compiled binaries can be obtained from https://github.com/nektro/andesite/releases/latest.

Or from Docker `docker run nektro/andesite`

## Development

### Prerequisites

- A directory you wish to proxy through Andesite
- The Go Language 1.12+ (https://golang.org/dl/)
- GCC on your PATH (for the https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 installation)

### Installing

Run
```
$ go get -v -u github.com/nektro/andesite
```
and then make your way to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/nektro/andesite/`.

Once there, run:
```
$ go build
$ ./andesite
```

## Extras

### Discord Guild/Role Access Grant

Due to a limitation in the Discord API, in order to determine if a user has a role on a specific server, you must use a bot. To get started, go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ and add a Bot user to your app and copy down the Bot Token. Now, to be able to give file/folder access to entire roles, we are going to be using more flags:

| Name | Config Name | Type | Default | Description |
|------|-------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `--discord-guild-id` | `"clients[for.discord].extra_1"` | `string` | none. | [Guild Snowflake](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/resources/guild). |
| `--discord-bot-token` | `"clients[for.discord].extra_2"` | `string` | none. | [Bot Token](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs/reference#authentication). |

Enabling these values will add a section to `http://andesite/admin` that you can input the role snowflakes and the path you are granting.

### Themes

Andesite supports making custom themes for the splash page and the various HTML templates throughout the program. Those are:
- `index.html` - [Default Source](./www/index.html)
    - The main page shown to all users at the root of the server.
- `response.hbs` - [Default Source](./www/response.hbs)
    - A generic page used to show errors and message to the user.
- `listing.hbs` - [Default Source](./www/listing.hbs)
    - The main directory listing page.
- `admin.hbs` - [Default Source](./www/admin.hbs)
    - The admin dashboard that allows editing the access of users.
- `style.css` - [Default Source](./www/style.css)
    - Empty CSS file you can use to easily make style-only themes.
- `users.hbs` - [Default Source](./www/users.hbs)
    - The admin dashboard that allows viewing of the list of users.
- `admin_roots.hbs` - [Default Source](./www/admin_roots.hbs)
    - The admin dashboard that allows viewing of all the data paths.

All or none of the files may be replaced when using a theme. To enable use of a theme, suppose the value passed to `--theme` was `example`. Doing this will tell Andesite to serve files from `.andesite/themes/example/`.
