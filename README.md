Share folders in an Open Directory without making your entire server public. Manages users with OAuth2.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
- A directory you wish to proxy through Andesite
- The Go Language 1.7+ (https://golang.org/dl/)
- GCC on your PATH (for the https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3 installation)

### Installing
Go to the developers dashboard of your choosing for the authentication platform you wish to use from the list below.

- Discord - https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/
- Reddit - https://old.reddit.com/prefs/apps
- GitHub - https://github.com/settings/developers

Once there, create an application and obtain the Client ID and Client Secret. Here you can also fill out a picture and description that will be displayed during the authorization of users on your chosen Identity Provider. When prompted for the "Redirect URI" during the app setup process, the URL to use will be `http://andesite/callback`, replacing `andesite` with any origins you wish Andesite to be usable from, such as `example.com` or `localhost`.

Once you have finished the app creation process and obtained the Client ID and Client Secret, create a folder in the root of the directory you will be serving with the name `.andesite`. If your file manager does not allow you to do this at first, you can open a command prompt/terminal and run `mkdir .andesite`.

In the `.andesite` folder make a `config.json` file and put the following data inside, replacing `AUTH` with whichever Identity Provider you chose, such as `discord`, `reddit`, etc. And `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` with their respective values. Do not worry, this folder will remain entirely private, even to users with full access.

```json
{
    "auth": "{AUTH}",
    "{AUTH}": {
        "id": "{CLIENT_ID}",
        "secret": "{CLIENT_SECRET}"
    }
}
```

> Note: You may only use one Identity Provider at a time!

Run
```
$ go get -u github.com/gobuffalo/packr/v2/packr2
$ go get -u github.com/nektro/andesite
```
and then make your way to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/nektro/andesite/`.

Once there, run:
```
$ packr2 build
$ ./andesite
```

> `packr2 build` is used here instead of `go run main.go` because `go run` creates a new binary every time which, since this program is a server, will request a firewall exception on every run. Using `packr2 build` overwrites the same binary `./andesite` over and over again as changes are made.

> `packr2 build` is used here over `go build` so that `packr2` can generate the resources necessary to embed the static resources into the resulting binary. This will allow the Andesite program to be run from anywhere.

### Options
- -root **Required**
    - A relative or absolute path to the directory you wish for Andesite to serve
- -port
    - The port Andesite will broadcast on. (Default `8000`)
- -admin
    - The ID of a user to add as an admin. Only required once. Admin priviledge allows this user to change the path access of other users. The User ID can be obtained from `/files/` once logged in.
- -theme
    - The name of the theme you want andesite to use for custom HTML and Handlebars templates.
- -base
    - Used when serving andesite from an HTTP root that is not `/`. See [`deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md) for more info. (Default: `/`)

## Themes
Andesite supports making custom themes for the splash page and the various HTML templates throughout the program. Those are:
- `index.html` - [Default Source](./www/index.html)
    - The main page shown to all users at the root of the server.
- `response.hbs` - [Default Source](./www/response.hbs)
    - A generic page used to show errors and message to the user.
- `listing.hbs` - [Default Source](./www/listing.hbs)
    - The main directory listing page.
- `admin.hbs` - [Default Source](./www/admin.hbs)
    - The admin dashboard that allows editing the access of users

### Using A Theme
All or none of the files may be replaced when using a theme. To enable use of a theme, suppose the value passed to `-theme` was `example`. Doing this will tell Andesite to serve files from `./.andesite/theme-example/`. This is so that multiple themes can be saved even though only one can be used at a time while keeping your `config.json` and any other private files private.
